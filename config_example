# Please it's very important to make sure there are 3 charact- #
# ers between the unit name and its configurations.            #
# For example:                                                 #
#                                                              #
# UnitName = configurations;                                   #
#                                                              #
# As you can see there are 3 characters between the unit name  #
# and the configurations (2 spaces and an equal sign).         #
# Also you must terminate each unit's configurations with a    #
# semicolon (';').                                             #
# If the unit's configurations are too long you can put it in- #
# side a pair of braces and make it a list. For example:       #
#                                                              #
# VeryLongUnit = {                                             #
#    config_1                                                  #
#    config_2                                                  #
#    config_3                                                  #
#    config_4                                                  #
# }; <- Don't forget to terminate the list                     #
#                                                              #
# If the list is group of commands you can add '&&' to the end #
# of each line. If the command requires root privileges you    #
# can just add sudo to the command. For example:               #
#                                                              #
# CommandsUnit = {                                             #
#    command 1 &&                                              #
#    sudo root_command 2 &&                                    #
#    command 3 &&                                              #
#    sudo root_command 3 &&                                    #
#    command 4                                                 #
# };                                                           #
#                                                              #
# Be aware that every new line in the list syntax is converted #
# into a space.                                                #
# Note: Please if you want to use indention for the list, only #
# use tabs, becuase they are ignored while reading a list.     #
# Lastly as you can see hashes ('#') are ignored.              #
# By the way, sorry for the hard syntax I really tried to make #
# as easy as I can and that's the result. I hope you like it :)#
